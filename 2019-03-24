I solve 2 problems using DP.
At first, It's a very easy problem. but I'dont pass at once.
I think there are two reasons.

1. Problem condition
In problem_No.2156, there are writed that don't drink continiously more than 3 glasses of wine.
But, I understand It can drink 3 glasses. So I submit wrong answer.

2. Memory limits
In problem_No.2293, I make an array of [110][11000] size.
But the size of memories given to me, only 4MB.
So It generate memory libits error.

When designing algoritm in the future, should check memeory size, problem condition.
