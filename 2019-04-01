I write code about LCA today. I have experience writing this algorithm, But don't remeber that.
Finally I search this algorithm. However I make two mistake.

First.

I don't test my code in function units. When computer print wrong answer, I can't find problem easliy.
Fortunally, I write method code by function. I realize importance of dividing code by function.

Second.

I don't give right name to variables. Later when I write method code, I am confused to using variable.
Because variables with simliar contents has similar name.
So computer print wrong answer. Then I spend a lot of time finding bugs.
In future, I give indepent variable name even if It's too long.
